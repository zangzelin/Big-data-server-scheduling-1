# Tianchi-server-scheduling-code-first-season
This code is the code for the first season of the organized Tianchi Server Dispatch Contest. I tried to use PYHON, MINZINC, GUROBI and other tools to solve the problem. I used the firstfit method, the localsearch method and the random algorithm. The first season was ranked 66.
