# Big-data-server-scheduling-1
This code solves the scheduling problem of a large number of servers.
The 68219 tasks are scheduled to 6000 servers, taking into account the constraints of the server's cpu, MEM, DISK, and app constraints.
I have tried to use PYHON, MINZINC, GUROBI and other tools to solve, using the firstfit method, localsearch method and random algorithm.
